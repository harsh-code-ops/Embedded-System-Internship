Qusetion - develop a program consist of two C file ( main.c and app.c ), app.c is having a static global variable, can we access it from main.c, if not, try to find a way still how we can access it from main.c ??

Answer - In app.c, the static global variable is limited to that file only, so it can't be directly accessed from main.c. If we try using extern in main.c, it gives a linker error because static gives internal linkage. However, we can still access its value indirectly by writing a normal (non-static) function like getCount() in app.c that returns the static variableâ€™s value. Since functions have external linkage by default, we can call them from main.c to read or update the variable. This way, the variable remains private, but its value is still accessible through controlled functions.
